## Overview

The AURORA Protocol addresses the high costs, limited liquidity, and access barriers to carbon credit certification, especially for small-scale farmers. Through Bitcoin staking with Babylon, it secures liquidity and returns for investors, while Rooch Network provides scalable, cross-chain smart contract execution to streamline transactions and optimize data flow.

## Key Features

- **Low-Cost Carbon Credit Certification**: Efficiently certifies carbon credits, making it accessible to smaller agricultural projects.
- **Bitcoin-Backed Yield Generation**: Uses Babylon Bitcoin staking to generate yields, ensuring liquidity and high returns for investors.
- **Scalability via Rooch Network**: Facilitates modular, high-volume smart contract execution to accommodate growth and cross-chain operability.
- **Smart Contracts for Investment & Return**: Securely manages investment cycles with two core smart contracts for streamlined returns.

## Architecture

1. **Invest Smart Contract**: Manages initial carbon credit investments, allocates funds for certification, and interfaces with Babylon for staking.
2. **Return Smart Contract**: Distributes returns to investors, pulling yield data from Babylon and executing distributions via Rooch Network.
3. **Babylon Staking Integration**: Generates staking yields from invested Bitcoin, which are processed and distributed to investors.
4. **Rooch Network**: Provides execution for high-volume transactions, ensuring real-time data flow, scalability, and interoperability.

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js** (v14.x or later)
- **npm** or **yarn**
- **Solidity** (for smart contract development)
- **Rooch CLI** (for deploying and managing contracts on the Rooch Network)
- **Babylon API Access** (for accessing staking yield data)
